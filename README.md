# Nature of Code

A sketchbook to experiment with making visuals and simulating nature via code. Many of the simulation prompts are from Daniel Schiffman's [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book) or other challenges on [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

Using p5.js with Typescript and Parcel doing the compiling/bundling.
