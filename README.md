# Nature of Code

A sketchbook to experiment with making visuals and simulating nature via code. Many of the simulation prompts are from Daniel Schiffman's [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book) or other challenges on [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

Using p5.js with Typescript and Parcel doing the compiling/bundling.


## Create a Sketch

To create a new sketch, run

```bash
npm run new-sim
```

in the terminal and follow the prompts. A templated file will be created, the corresponding index and data files will be updated, and the page will be immediately available to view in the dev server.
